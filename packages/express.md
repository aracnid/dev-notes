Install Express Globally
========================

```
# npm install -g express
$ express --version; # this doesn't seem to work
$ npm list -g | grep express; # this will verify the version of express
```

If that doesn't work, install the express generator.
```
# npm install -g express-generator@4
$ express --version
```
